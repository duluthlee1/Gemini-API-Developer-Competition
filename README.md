# Gemini-API-Developer-Competition

Project Overview

Our project focuses on advancing the fabrication process of semiconductor devices, especially those based on novel materials beyond conventional silicon-based CMOS technology. As transistors are fundamental components in integrated circuits, their performance heavily relies on the quality of the channels, which are often prepared through exfoliation. Traditionally, the assessment of these channels' quality, including width measurement, is conducted manually under optical or Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) using specialized software.

To automate and enhance this process, we have developed a web-based application utilizing the Gemini API and advanced image processing techniques. This tool allows users to upload images of their samples, which are then analyzed to provide immediate feedback on the channel widths and the overall suitability of the samples for device fabrication. Additionally, we have created and trained our own dataset for segmentation models based on the UNet architecture to ensure accurate and reliable results.

This innovation is particularly beneficial for research teams working on nano devices and novel semiconductor materials, offering them a convenient, efficient, and automated solution for quality assessment during the semiconductor fabrication process.
